This file includes errors we faced during implementation and solutions if we find any.

Mobile:
OpenCV - Library version issue. Did not resolve even when new versions are used in Android studio.
Caffe with Alexnet, CaffeNet - Issue in accessing to Lib path. Even the lib is present in the same path as the error shows,the code is not identifying it.
Analyzed and tried to provide the lib in all possible default paths but still not accessible.

Atomic Pi: Latest version of tensorflow is not deployable due to out of memory issue. Used Tensorflow 1.5 version as per analysis and mentions on few blogs.
